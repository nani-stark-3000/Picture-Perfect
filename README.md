# Image Quality Assessment Web App

This is a Flask web application for image quality assessment. It allows users to upload images, applies blur to them, calculates SSIM (Structural Similarity Index Measure) scores, and categorizes the images based on their quality.

![Demo Video](https://github.com/nani-stark-3000/Picture-Perfect/blob/825860a90bb99e875b1b94ee3370b979ccfb5e6b/Project%20Video%20ultra%20compressed.mp4)

## Features

- **Upload Images**: Users can upload multiple images at once.
- **Blur Images**: The uploaded images are processed to apply Gaussian blur.
- **SSIM Calculation**: SSIM scores are calculated to assess the similarity between images.
- **Image Categorization**: Images are categorized as 'good' or 'bad' based on the SSIM threshold.
- **Download**: Users can download the 'good' images as a zip file.
